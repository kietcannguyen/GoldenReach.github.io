description: My name is Truman Shek, I am a 17-year-old highschool student. Growing up, I often visited my grandparents, where I witnessed the love and care they provided for me. Inspired by their dedication, I wanted to ensure that seniors receive the care they truly deserve. Through my involvement with Golden Reach, Iâ€™ve been able to foster companionship and support within the senior community. This experience has allowed me to bridge the gap between generations, connecting youth with older adults in meaningful ways.
