description: Hi! I'm Megan Nguyen, a 17-year-old high school student and founder of the Golden Reach Organization. After volunteering at a local memory care home, I saw a gap in connection between youth and seniors. I started this nonprofit to promote meaningful intergenerational relationships and engage passionate individuals who want to bring love and companionship to seniors during their golden years. I welcome you all to join us on our mission of bridging this divide.
