description: Hi, my name is Kytlyn Bui, a 18-year-old high school senior. Recently, I've noticed a growing gap between the younger and older generations in our community, which inspired me to co-found Golden Reach. Our nonprofit organization is committed to fostering connections between seniors and younger individuals, which I strongly believe is highly beneficial for both generations. This mission holds a special place in my heart because I believe every senior deserves to feel valued and supported, especially during their golden years. Serving as a co-founder, I am dedicated to making a meaningful impact in promoting togetherness in our community. I'm excited to share more about our journey and the significant impact Golden Reach plans to create.
